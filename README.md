## Usage

1. Click **Start Exploring** on home screen.
2. Click **Generate Random** to see new colors.
3. Enter a hex code (e.g., `#FF6347`) to set a custom color.
4. Click **Copy** to copy current color code.
5. Color history shows recent colors; click any color to set it.
6. Save current color as a profile with a name.
7. View saved profiles, load or delete them.

---

## Notes

* The app remembers the last active screen (home/app), selected color, history, and saved profiles using localStorage.
* Color profile history is limited to latest 20 profiles.
* Color history stores latest 10 colors.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add multi-color palette save (e.g., top 5 colors per profile)
* Add export/import JSON options
* Add theme toggle (light/dark) + high contrast styles
* Add unit tests / end-to-end tests
